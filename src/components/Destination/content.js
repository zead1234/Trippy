    "description": "One of the most iconic views in Luzon, Mt. Taal boasts a volcano inside a lake inside an island. If you fancy a closer look, the hike up to the crater is a mere two hours. It's easy enough for beginners as guides assist you most of the way, and you get to see the peculiar environment found on an active volcano, including volcanic rocks and steam vents. The hike can be dusty and hot, so plan for an early morning trip and then unwind with some bulalo before heading back home.",
